PROJECT: Predictive Policing for Social Good
STUDENT: 
UFID5-8: 
DATE: 11 SEPT 2018

STATEMENT OF WORK:
Task 0. Conduct research on predictive policing

	Research should consist of literature search as well as evaluation of the
	existing solutions. Emphasis will be placed on how we can achieve
	positive outcomes using machine learning and predictive analytics as
	opposed to how we can incarcerate citizens to reduce crime.
	
Task 1. Clean the city of Chicago crime data and upload it to PostGIS

	Clean and prepare the Chicago crime data for being loaded into a
	spatial database. Attempt to utilize as much of the data as possible.
	Upload all of the cleaned data to a spatial database when completed
	(PostGIS will be used).

Task 2. Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict crime

	Create a machine learning algorithm using decision tree learning or
	possibly random forest generation to predict the time and place of
	future crimes.

Task 3. Create a GUI to view the spatial data

	Build a GUI to allow users to interact with and visualize where our
	prediction algorithm thinks crime will occur. This will also have the
	limited ability to view crimes that have been commited (limited due to
	size of data set). The GUI will be built primarily with Python.

Task 4. Create a recomendation engine for reducing crime

	Based on research, we will built several solutions into the machine
	learning algorithm. These solutions will be recommended based on existing
	crime type and prediction level. The goal is to implement things to reduce
	the crime level rather than to arrest citizens.	

Task 5. Document results in final report

DELIVERABLES: Project deliverables will consist of:
	1. Documents supporting our methodologies and design employed in the project.

	2. Source code for the working final project. This will be delivered in a Linux compatible
	Docker container format. All requirements and installation instructions will be
	properly outlined in the documentation. Performance of the system will vary greatly
	depending on hardware specifications.

	3. A hosted version of the final project will be kept online for viewing by the instructor
	and advisor. The hosted version will be linked by a URL for ease of use so colleagues and
	others in the department may view the project without installing it. After the completion
	of the course, this deliverable will be taken down.

	4. Final report
