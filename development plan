Chicago police data->postGIS->algorithm->web interface


divide chicago into block sizes that reflect the precision of the crime location data

map available crime data onto those geoblocks

map additional factor data onto those geoblocks

calculate information gain/entropy with regards to each attribute associated with all blocks containing a targeted crime

sort attributes by information gain

branch on the highest entropy attribute-record entropy and attribute

repeat until the tree is finished, either all attributes used or all remaining attributes have low information gain


run
