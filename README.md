###### A useful CI/CD deployment software that might be nice to use. We could probably deploy with very little work. https://concourse-ci.org/
###### Open source graphing library (not sure about performance for large projects with this) https://plot.ly/
###### GIS Spatial Addition to PostGRES http://www.postgis.net/
###### Probably the best way to deploy Python apps to a web platform. We can use these for testing as well. https://www.docker.com/
###### Useful for container orchestration possibly. Using simple Docker containers might just be easier though. https://kubernetes.io/
###### Flask - static website generation using Python and markdown language. Probbaly the best bet for creating the site itself. We could also use this to create the microservices possibly... http://flask.pocoo.org/
###### Python Linters: https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/12/09/how-python-linters-will-save-your-large-python-project/
